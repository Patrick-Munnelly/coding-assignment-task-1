Task Two

I added the three tasks

Added infinite scroll so that once you get to the lat movie that is present in the web page it will load the next page of movies. This was created using a react hook that is called when the user has the last movie on screen.


Added a grid for the movies. Set the the gird to only be shown condiotnally if the screen is above a certain size. I set it to be any size over 800 pixels.

Added the movie trailer modal.

The modal was created using the package reactjs-popup.
 

I added a fix for the search feature as it was not clearing the movie name if you click the clear button in the search input.


I added  unit tests for to check you can open and close the movie card overlay.  to check you can open and close theMovie trailer modal.
to check you can save a movie into your favourites. 
to check you can remove a movie into your favourites. 
Increased the time out for api calls to take into account poor internet connection.



I added e2e tests for the three tasks required.
